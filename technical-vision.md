# OpenSSF Technical Vision (v1), left for reference

We envision a future where participants in the open source ecosystem use and share high quality software, with security handled proactively, by default, and as a matter of course:
- Developers can easily learn secure development practices and are proactively guided by their tools to apply those practices and automatically informed when action is needed to prevent, remediate, or mitigate security issues.
- Developers, auditors, and regulators can create and easily distribute security policies that are enforced through tooling and automation, providing continuous assurance of the results.
- Developers and researchers can identify security issues (including unintentional vulnerabilities and malicious software) and have this information swiftly flow backwards through the supply chain to someone who can rapidly address the issue.
- Community members can provide information and notifications about product defects, mitigations, quality, and supportability and have this information rapidly flow forward across the ecosystem system to all users, and users can rapidly update their software or implement mitigations as appropriate.

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) provides tools, services, training, infrastructure, and resources to achieve this vision.

# OpenSSF Technical Vision (v2 proposed)

An aspirational view of the future we seek to create in 2-5 years:

- OpenSSF is a well-respected strategic partner to both large OSS foundations and individual OSS projects
    - Clearly positioned within ecosystem with a clear charter
    - Catalyst for change and improving “secure by default”
    - Trusted voice to consumers, producers, and market
- Regardless of (programming language, VCS, CI platform, etc), consumers of OSS can rely on clear & consistent trusted signals of:
    - Provenance of source code & artifacts
    - Security posture of projects and artifacts
    - Community health
    - Maintainer intent (e.g. project archived, not responsive to PRs, etc)
    - Consumer demand
    - ...
- Producers of OSS (at all levels of skill) have access to:
    - Best practices guides, education, etc
    - Extremely low-friction tooling to make security processes less onerous, more accurate, and trusted (burden of maintenance offloaded through opt-in automation)
    - Ability to start new projects from a more secure default position
    - ...
- OpenSSF is an influential advocate of efforts that are aligned with OpenSSF's mission
    - Meaningful, actionable standards (e.g. SBOM formats?)
    - Interests and motivations of all parties are respected
    - Catalyze improvements / action
    - Ensure sufficient staffing, auditing, pen testing, rigor
    - Multi-factor authentication
    - ...
