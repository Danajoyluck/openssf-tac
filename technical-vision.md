# OpenSSF Technical Vision

An aspirational view of the future we seek to create in 2-5 years:

### OpenSSF is a well-respected strategic partner to large OSS foundations and individual OSS projects
- OpenSSF is clearly positioned within broader ecosystem with a clear, altruistic charter
- Periodically review the value proposition of OpenSSF with key stakeholders
  - Joint OKRs on shared execution, utilization of OpenSSF-managed tools & content
  - Roadmap alignment: if overlap exists between OpenSSF and another stakeholder, either publicly document rationale OR create/document/execute a convergence plan
- OpenSSF speaks with a trusted voice to consumers, producers, and the broader market

### OpenSSF is an influential advocate for mutually-beneficial external efforts and an educator of policy decision makers
- Support creation & use of meaningful, actionable standards (e.g. SBOM formats, MFA)
- OpenSSF acts as a catalyst for change and improving “secure by default”
- Advocacy may be statements of support, education material, and/or direct funding

### Consumers of OSS can leverage clear & consistent trusted signals to better understand the security profile of open source content
- Including (but not exclusively) provenance of source code & artifacts, security posture of projects and artifacts, community health metrics, vulnerability information, and measures of consumer demand (e.g. criticality score)
- Consumers of OSS quickly understand the maintainer’s intentions regarding not only the license but also the project’s security posture (e.g. project archived, accepting PRs, etc)
- All consumers of OSS (including producers of OSS who consume dependencies) will have access to training, tooling, and security information to make educated choices as they interact with the open source ecosystem

### Producers of OSS (of all skill levels) have the ability to proactively and reactively address both existing and emergent security threats
- Best practices guides & education materials that ensure both current and future OSS developers obtain & maintain sufficient secure development skills
- Extremely low-friction, automated tooling to make security processes less onerous, more accurate, and trusted (burden of maintenance offloaded through opt-in automation)
- Ability to start new projects from a more secure default position
- Ensure sufficient staffing, auditing, continuous testing, rigor for critical projects
