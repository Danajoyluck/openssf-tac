# 2024 Q2 Alpha-Omega

## Overview

The Alpha-Omega Directed Fund continues our mission, to catalyze sustainable security improvements to the world's most critical open source projects and ecosystems. We do this by applying funding and influence in four key areas:

* Staffing dedicated security roles within critical ecosystems/foundations
* Funding work to improve security for artifact repositories / package registries
* Funding security audits and remediation, often as a precusor to additional work
* Experimentation

### Recent Updates

* OpenSSL 3.1 security audit completed.
* Homebrew 

## Objectives & Key Results

|Key Result|Status|
|-|-|
|**O1: Catalyze trustworthy and secure software, runtimes, and infrastructure for all the major open source ecosystems through staffing**||
|KR 1.1: Fund security improvements and initiatives for at least ten critical open source organizations by the end of 2024. |On target|
|KR 1.2: For each engagement, confirm progress toward improved security outcomes, evidenced through initial and/or follow-on assessments, monthly reporting, and periodic check-ins.|On target|
|KR 1.3: Drive the organizations we work with to obtain security funding from at least one organization other than Alpha-Omega, targeting 33% by the end of 2024.|On target|
|KR 1.4: Organize quarterly roundtables for at least 5 major ecosystems  to share information, build connections, and collaborate, resulting in at least one new project or joint publication started in 2024.|On target|
|**O2: The top 10,000 open source projects are free of critical security vulnerabilities**||
|KR 2.1: Drive adoption of key security processes, including static analysis, credential scanning, the use of private vulnerability disclosures, structured metadata (Security Insights) and the use of multi-factor authentication by maintainers of 500 critical projects from the top 10,000 by the end of 2024.|Planning|
|KR 2.2: Independently scan, triage, and notify maintainers when critical vulnerabilities are found in 2,000 projects, chosen from the top 10,000 by the end of June 2024, with emphasis on clearing a "section of the beach" by focusing on the top PyPI packages.|On target|
|KR 2.3: Publish in a machine readable format the attestations for all packages from 2.2 that returned no vulnerabilities and those that found vulnerabilities which were subsequently fixed and verified.|On target|
|**O3: Enhance Alpha-Omega's effectiveness in driving security improvements through deliberate innovation and experimentation**||
|KR 3.1: By the end of 2024, run three experiments to explore new strategies for reducing security risk within the open source ecosystems, share the results/learnings, using them to refine our overall strategy and objectives for 2025.|Not started|
|**O4: Run an operationally efficient and effective program**||
|KR 4.1: Allocate at least 85% of our yearly spend to activities directly in support of our mission.|On Target|
|KR 4.2: Receive at least $5 million in renewed funding in 2024.|Completed|
|KR 4.3: For each partner engagement, at least 70% of the objectives defined within the respective agreement are met within the defined time period.|On target|

### Purpose

To catalyze sustainable security improvements to the world's most critical open source projects and ecosystems.

### Current Status

We're active and healthy. Our team consists of Michael Scovetta (Microsoft), Henri Yandell (Amazon Web Services), Bob Callaway (Google), supported by Michael Winser (contractor) and Michelle Martineau and Tracy Li from the Linux Foundation. We've received $5M in funding so far in 2024 and are actively meeting with new potential engagement partners. We meet at least weekly as a team and most weeks, meet with at least a few partners (actual or potential).

### Up Next

We're finalizing details on a few new engagements - details will be shared with TAC privately through the private TAC mailing list.

Some key opportunities to engage:

* Our next monthly report is due out around July 5th.
* Our next roundtable (for grant recipients and selected guests) will be held on July 25th.
* Our next public meeting will be held on August 7th.
* We'll have a roundtable at Open Source Summit EU in September and are planning to attend the LF Member Summit.

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

No, but as always, we're eager for substantive discussion with TAC and others.
