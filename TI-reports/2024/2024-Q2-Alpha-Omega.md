# 2024 Q2 Alpha-Omega

## Overview

<mark>
The Alpha-Omega Directed Fund continues our mission, to catalyze sustainable security improvements to the world's most critical open source projects and ecosystems. We do this by applying funding and influence in four key areas:

* Staffing dedicated security roles within critical ecosystems/foundations
* Funding work to improve security for artifact repositories / package registries
* Funding security audits and remediation, often as a precusor to additional work
* Experimentation

Our team consists of Michael Scovetta (Microsoft), Henri Yandell (Amazon Web Services), Bob Callaway (Google), supported by Michael Winser (contractor) and Michelle Martineau and Tracy Li from the Linux Foundation. We've received $5M in funding so far in 2024 and are actively meeting with new potential engagement partners.
