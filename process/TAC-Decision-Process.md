# TAC Decision Process #

The OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a body comprised of 9 individuals that are either elected for a 2 year term or appointed by the governing board for a 1 year term.

The TAC has a chairperson and vice-chairperson that are elected by the TAC members annually and are responsible for organizing and coordinating the TAC to conduct the technical management and oversight of the foundation's Technical Initiatives.  The TAC chair acts as a standing voting member of the Governance Committee (GC), and the vice-chair acting as their alternate/delegate.  A second TAC member, as determined by the TAC, is also included as a voting member of the GC. 

Broadly, there are three main methods that the TAC will use to make decisions and ensure those decisions are appropriately documented:

## 1.) Simple and/or non-consequential changes ##
For asynchronous work items that do not have long-term/strategic consequences, the TAC will use lazy consensus to determine whether to adopt the proposal and ensure that it will be properly documented.  Issues and PRs should be created within the TAC GitHub repository and assigned to the TAC group for review.  Provided that at least two TAC members agree, support, and approve the suggested change, there are no objections raised by any TAC members, and no less than one week has transpired since the TAC was notified of the change, the proposal will be merged and adopted.

This includes such things as documentation updates/minor changes


## 2.) For work items discussed at the periodic TAC calls ##
The TAC must have quorum (majority of members present) and a simple majority of the members present must approve of a proposal or topic.  This decision will be captured in the TAC meeting notes as well as an issue within the TAC repository. 



## 3.) For  major items that require a formal vote ##
An issue or PR must be created within the TAC repository.  TAC members will be asked via the TAC mailing list to review, comment, and decline/approve the item within the GitHub issue/PR.  The TAC will be given 10 business days to review and consider the request.  These topics ideally should also be presented at a TAC meeting and publicly discussed/debated prior to the closing of voting.  

This includes items such as changes to the TAC technical vision, Foundation strategy, WG/project adoption, funding requests, etc.
