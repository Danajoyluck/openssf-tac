## Application for creating a new project at Sandbox stage

### List of project maintainers
The project must have a minimum of two maintainers with different organizational affiliations.
  * "name, affiliation, GitHub ID"

### Sponsor
The project should be aligned with an existing OpenSSF Working Group, SIG, or Project (TI).  The project commits to providing the hosting TI quarterly updates on progress.
  * "name of TI that will host this project"

### Mission of the project
The project must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.
  * "description of the project mission"

### IP policy and licensing due diligence
When contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF).
  * "yes / no / not applicable. If yes, provide a link to the corresponding GitHub issue."
  
### Project References
The project should provide a list of existing resources with links to the repository, and if available, website, a roadmap, contributing guide, demos and walkthroughs, and any other material to showcase the existing breadth, maturity, and direction of the project.
