# "Gives and Gets" for OpenSSF Technical Initiatives (TI)
The OpenSSF has a large community of contributors and efforts that span the broad spectrum of open source security interests.  The Technical Initiatives (TIs) of the foundation are where community members collaborate and help craft unique solutions to address improving the security of the open source ecosystem.
In exchange for meeting certain requirements, the TIs are eligible to receive an assortment of benefits and have access to the capabilities of the Foundation's resources.  The specific requirements and benefits (aka "Gives and Gets") for each level of maturity are documented below.  Based on the specific type of work the TI is focused on (e.g a software project vs. a specification or documentation-based effort) the requirements and benefits may slightly differ as applicable.


## Sandbox level Gives & Gets

|     Gives/Requirements             |                Gets/Benefits          |
| :-----------------------------:    | :-----------------------------------: | 
|  TI must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas or address an unfulfilled need. It is expected that the initial code needed for an OpenSSF WG to work be kept within their repository and will not function as a project in its own right. Should initial WG code grow and mature that it warrants its own Project status, then it is subject to Sandbox entry requirements. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project. |    TI can get assistance with Architecture & Roadmap Alignment      | 
|  TI must maintain a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project).  TI must have a minimum of two maintainers with different organization affiliations. | Receives consideration as in-scope for any submission to an OpenSSF-managed conference or event. |
|  TI must find an aligned WG to host the TI and must have a TAC sponsor that can help guide the TI through processes.  | TI receives guidance on technical direction from TAC sponsor  |
|  TI agrees to follow the [Secure Software Development Guiding Principles](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/SecureSoftwareGuidingPrinciples.md) and the [Open Source Consumption Manifesto](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers/tree/main/MANIFESTO). | Receives OpenSSF Code of Conduct Committee support.|
|  If contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF). | Reserved space for project updates in OpenSSF newsletters.|
|  Provides quarterly updates to the TAC on technical vision and progress on vision.  | May request infrastructure support from the OpenSSF. |
|  TI will have a [SECURITY.md](http://security.md/) that describes how the Project manages vulnerabilities, or more broadly how the OSSF handles vulnerability reports  |  Projects may say they are, "A sandbox project in the OpenSSF" or "An experimental project in the OpenSSF."  Gets an "sandbox" logo that is shared amongst all OpenSSF sandbox TIs.  |
|    | Communication & Collaboration - OpenSSF mailing list, OpenSSF Slack channel, OpenSSF GitHub, OpenSSF Calendaring / Recording,  OpenSSF Social Media & External Engagement Support |
|    | Governance & Administration - TI Charter Development & Review, TI Technical Steering Committee Setup, TI IP & License Review, TI Operations & Maintenance, Technical Support |


## Incubating level Gives & Gets

|     Gives/Requirements             |                Gets/Benefits          |
| :-----------------------------:    | :-----------------------------------: | 
|  All requirements of Sandbox must be fulfilled. PR filed to promote group to Incubating stage.  |  TI eligible to receive all Gets from Sandbox  |
|  Group has met no less than 5 times within the last calendar quarter | Receives infrastructure support   |
|  Maintains a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project) with an active flow of contributions.  Projects must have a minimum of three maintainers with a minimum of two different organization affiliations, and document the current list of maintainers.  |  Receives consideration as in-scope for any submission to an OpenSSF-managed conference or event.  |
|  Projects must have defined a contributor guide, which makes it clear how and when contributors should be given increasing responsibilities towards maintainership of the project. (Example guides: Sigstore, AllStar) | Project may request custom OpenSSF Logo for group   |
|  Projects should be able to show adoption by multiple parties and adoption's value to the open source community and/or end users (may include adoption of beta/early versions) with the intent to showcase wide adoption by the project's consumers.  |  Projects may use the OpenSSF logo to promote their project (in accordance with the trademark guidelines). Projects may not be referred to as an "OpenSSF Project" or "OpenSSF $ProjectName." Projects may say they are an "OpenSSF Incubating Project."  |
|  TI must have documented, initial group governance.  | With additional TAC or WG approval, may fundraise for dedicated project funds, coordinated by the OpenSSF.   |
| Maintains a point of contact for vulnerability reports in the security.md |   Receives support with vulnerability disclosure from the OpenSSF (Vulnerability Disclosure WG). | 
|  Implements, practices, and refines mature software development and release practices such as following a version schema. |
| TI Follows security best practices (as recommended by the OpenSSF and others), including passing the OpenSSF Best Practices criteria | May post project updates and tutorials to the OpenSSF blog.  |
| Project should be integrating with Scorecards  |  |
|  Begins to establish the appropriate governance that enables its sustainment for potential graduation.| |
| Projects should be Securing Code Repository -> Managing Contributions Commit Signing , Secret Scanning, Code Scanning (OSFUZZ at a minimum) + Self-assessment Should OpenSSF require these if the SCM supports it, especially using Sigstore? |  |

## Graduated level Gives & Gets
|     Gives/Requirements             |                Gets/Benefits          |

|  Projects must have documented project governance and be able to demonstrate that governance in action.  |  May request OpenSSF budget for project improvements such as security audits or time-bound contracting needs.  |
|  When applicable, projects must have completed a security audit through a third party and addressed audit findings and recommendations.  |  May request OpenSSF budget for sustained maintainer stipends (details determined by OpenSSF and project leads).  |
|   When applicable, Projects should achieve **BLAH** level of SLSA  | With additional TAC or WG approval, may fundraise for dedicated project funds, coordinated by the OpenSSF.|
