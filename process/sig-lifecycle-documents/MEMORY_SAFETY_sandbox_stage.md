## Creation of a new Special Interest Group (SIG) at Sandbox stage

### Proposed focus, intent, goals, and/or deliverables

Our Motivation, Objective, and Scope are outlined in the [README of our repo](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/blob/main/README.md)

Our original deliverable was revised language for Stream 4 of the OpenSSF's Mobilization plan. Our revised language for Stream 4 is [here](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/blob/main/docs/revised-stream-4-language.md).

We also established [common definitions of memory safety terms](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/blob/main/docs/definitions.md) to refer to in our work.

Our in progress deliverables include:
* [Best Practices - Memory-Safe By Default Languages](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/blob/main/docs/best-practice-memory-safe-by-default-languages.md)
* [Best Practices - Non-Memory-Safe By Default Languages](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/blob/main/docs/best-practice-non-memory-safe-by-default-languages.md)
* [The Memory Safety Continuum](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety/pull/20)
