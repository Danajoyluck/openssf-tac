   <td>As the OpenSSF SCIR I will bring to the board a strong technical security community perspective. My 15+ year security career has been primarily developer- and community-focused. I will channel this energy and focus on developing the security capabilities of the OpenSSF and the broader open-source community. I am a product security engineer, architect, and leader with experience in all phases of the development process “from concept to end of life”, with an emphasis on security by design of software, hardware, and organizational systems. I co-authored “Threat Modeling: A Practical Guide for Development Teams”, co-creator of the Threat Modeling Manifesto, and a founding member and maintainer of the pytm project (an OWASP Incubator project for "threat modeling as code"). I have been actively involved in open community initiatives with participation in the Hardware CWE and CWE/CAPEC User Experience working groups (led by MITRE), OWASP, and the OpenSSF End User WG and Security Toolbelt SIG. I am also involved in efforts at SAFECode and FIRST. I work at Dell Technologies in the Product and Application Security team helping Dell product teams design and implement secure systems with responsible consumption and use of open-source components. I believe my experience lends itself well to the SCIR role of the OpenSSF GB, where I will utilize my experiences in developer focused security to ensure strategic efforts are consumable and actionable for the developer community at large.
