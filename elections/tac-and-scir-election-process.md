# TAC and SCIR Election Procedures

This document outlines the election process for the OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) and Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR).


## Voter Eligibility (Electorate) Self-Nomination Process

Any contributor to OpenSSF working groups, SIGs, or projects is eligible to participate in the election.
Valid contributions include: commits or submitted pull requests via Github; public edits or comments on Google docs or other work products associated with OpenSSF; posting messages to any mailing list or on Slack; and beyond that any other form of positive engagement with OpenSSF activities.
The voter eligibility form asks you for an example of your contributions; this is merely to make it easier for the Election Officials and OpenSSF staff to validate eligibility.
If you have in any way been involved in or care about OpenSSF, but are in doubt as to whether your contribution “counts”, please fill it out anyways, and we will follow up.

## SCIR Self-Nomination Information and Process

Since early in its existence, the OpenSSF Governing Board has sought to ensure it gets adequate input from voices in the software security community who would otherwise not be at the table.
We seek candidates for the Security Community Individual Representative (SCIR) who can represent those voices, while also being a subject matter expert in the field with their own set of perspectives.
Familiarity with the different OpenSSF working groups and projects, and being able to dedicate the time to be sufficiently informed on the issues that arise in our monthly calls and ongoing discussions, is highly desired.
It is also highly desired, but not required, that the SCIR be a contributor and thus eligible to vote in the election.

## Election Process

The Election Process will be monitored by Election Officials, who
* review nominees and confirm their eligibility,
* approve the election timeline, and
* review the ballot request form and validate voter eligibility.

Election Officials are eligible community members who have volunteered to oversee and help ensure the integrity of the election process. By volunteering in this role, they recuse themselves from running for a TAC or SCIR position but they still are allowed to vote in the election.

During the validation period, the Election Officials will review the pool of eligible voters to confirm eligibility to participate in the election, per the guidelines defined above.
At the conclusion of the validation period, Election Officials will publish the complete list of candidates.

If there are more nominees than positions for either the TAC or the SCIR, the election will be conducted using the electronic voting tool Opavote.
A Single Transferable Voting method will be used for the TAC as there are multiple candidates. 
Eligible voters will receive an invitation to access their ballot from Opavote.
The ballot will include the option to vote for both the TAC and SCIR.

Questions related to the nomination and/or election process should be directed to [operations@openssf.org](mailto:operations@openssf.org).
